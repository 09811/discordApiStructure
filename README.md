# discordApiStructure
This is the Discord API structure "visualized" with a folder system


The folders must be seperated by / so you "navigate through" the API

The res.txt file is the response you will get when requesting this path/url/position with GET 
The payload.json is what you have to send for example to send Messages/Embeds
The onPosting.txt shows the response when sending the payload.json with POST

Might have some mistakes please open a issue 
I will keep adding more
